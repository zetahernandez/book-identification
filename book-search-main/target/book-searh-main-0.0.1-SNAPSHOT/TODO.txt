Your EmberJS + RequireJS project is almost ready! Here's how to get started:

- Change lang="en" in the <html> tag if your page is not in English

- Fill:
  <title></title>
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="author" content="">

- Change the favicons

- Start writing your app writing models, views, controllers and templates in in scripts/app/models, scripts/app/views... and so on. To make them public update scripts/app/main (following module pattern).

- Change the name of your app in config.js, setting the variable "app_name"

- Describe your application HTML in index.html.

- Make a 404.html page if you have a 404 redirection in your server configuration file

- Use CSS versioning to force the cache refresh:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css?v=[current_version]">
